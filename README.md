Abyss ORPG from Warcraft 3 in DotA 2

This is my little side project from tcw (check my repos). Tcw definitely isnt dead.

This repo has two purposes 

1) To gauge the interest of dota 2 gamers in RPGs. I can blow this out in 1/20th the time than I can tcw.
2) To get tenkz involved in modding

two birds with one stone.

btw content won't follow abyss to the bullet but the gameplay will follow a similar style
